Easy RST
==============================================

This mini-framework aims to simplify the use of the restructure-text
processing library, such that target document formats can easily be created
with minimal lines of code.

The main idea is that you create a template (e.g. template.tex), then fill in
the blanks with snippets compiled from restructure-text.

Currently supports some simple latex processing, which I use to generate
academic papers and beamer lecture slides
